This provides a set of interfaces that conform to the Local Waste Service Standards Project

https://www.localdigitalcoalition.uk/product/local-waste-service-standards-project/

This project acted as a foundation project for the Services created on this site but for various reasons we had
to diverge from this project in a number of cases. Hopefully we can feed back into the project.

We have stuck pretty closely to the models outlined in that project however.
